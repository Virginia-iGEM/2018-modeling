# SaveData Function

## Automatic Use:

Add the following line once your simulation loop completes:

SaveData(M_cells, Psi_cells);

This assumes that M_cells and Psi_cells are the variables to be saved and exist.

A warning on data usage: If every single useless test simulation is saved and committed to the Git repository, the repository can quickly inflate to several gigabytes (anywhere from a few to a few hundred depending on the size of the simulation). This will both take up a lot of space on your computer, make it so that cloning/pulling/merging/committing to the repository takes several minutes, and may result in an angry email from GitHub.

You don't have to be stingy. You can save many simulations (it's okay if we have around a hundred or so I'm guessing), but don't save *everything*. Just the stuff that matters.

Note that you can rename and move folders containing saved datasets. Nothing will explode.

## Manual use:

In the Matlab console, type:

SaveData(M_cells, Psi_cells)

## Loading data

In order to retrieve the results of previous simulations for data analysis, click the `Open` button which can be found in the `Home` or `Editor` tab of Matlabs toolbar. Navigate to the project folder if you aren't already there, and then the `data` folder. Select the simulation from the date/time that you want, and double click on the .mat file.

The simulation's M_cells and Psi_cells data will be loaded. No other simulation parameters or information will be loaded.
